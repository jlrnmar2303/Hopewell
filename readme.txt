The Hopewell Project by Jennifer Riney /Code Louisville. A website designed to provide
information about Hopewell Presbyterian Church in Louisville KY. Also designed in hopes of
recruiting new members, and providing updates for existing members. I added some jQuery
 functionality to create changes after joining the mailing list.
